# Face recognizer with SURF
# @author: Christian Reichel
# Based on: OpenCV tutorial for face recognition
# Version: 0.1
# -----------------------------------------------------
# This script detects and recognizes a face though
# SURF operation and recording of training data as a
# video file.
#
# A brief step by step explanation of the algorithm:
# 1) Camera image taken, SURF features computed.
# 2) Match against the own database of training data.
#    a) if match: continue
#    b) if not: 
#       1) Ask for a name.
#       2) Record images or a video as training data.
#       3) Match training data with current. If it
#          isn't matching, record again.
# 3) Show name as label.
